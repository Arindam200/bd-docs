# Deep Research Agent Architecture

The **Research Layer** executes complex, multi-source retrieval, ranking, and evidence synthesis at enterprise scale. Essential for due diligence, market monitoring, and real-time intelligence.

### Hybrid Retrieval & Synthesis

- **Multi-engine discovery:** Google/Bing, vertical APIs, internal documents, historic web archives.
- **Ranking:** ML-driven evidence scoring; keyword+embedding hybrid ranking.
- **Latency:** Targets p95 <3s for queries (<500ms source lookup with aggressive concurrency).
- **Proof:** Benchmark: 98% source coverage of target Fortune 1000 domains.

### Best Practices

- Use hybrid SERP + vector search for maximum coverage.
- Always cache high-value retrievals with expiry.
- Chain-of-thought LLM for structured, multi-source analysis.

## Reference Code

```python
from brightdata import ResearchAgent
agent = ResearchAgent()
result = agent.query("AI startup funding 2024")
print(result["summary"])
```
