# Deep Research Agent

## What is it?
- Get multi-source, verified insights on any topic (market, competitor, news...)
- Combines latest news, company info, reports—all in one agent
- Works at real scale (hundreds of sources, parallel, auto-fact-checking)
- Battle-tested on the most “protected” sources

## How it works
1. You send a query (e.g. “AI startup funding trends Q4 2024”)
2. Orchestrator breaks down research into tasks
3. Discovers best current & historic sources (web, SERPs, archives)
4. Unlocks, extracts, and checks facts across sources
5. Summarizes findings and delivers a synthesized, cited report

## Simple Flow
```text
 [Query]
   |
[Orchestrator/Planner]
   |
[Find Sources (SERP, Archive)]
   |
[Extract/Unlock/Verify Data]
   |
[Synthesize & Summarize]
   |
[Final Report/Export]
```

## Best Practices
- Always use async for long-running or source-heavy research
- Use both current (SERP) and historic (Archive) data for best coverage
- Fact-check with >3 sources for critical answers

## Why use this?
- 10-100x faster than any manual analyst or classic scraping script
- Verifies facts and cross-references—real trust, no hallucinations
- Handles login/forms, paywalled/protected sources
- Instantly scales to 100+ concurrent research jobs
