# Data Enrichment Agent Architecture

The **Enrichment Layer** automates ingestion, cleaning, and augmentation of company/contact records at scale. Built for streaming/real-time and batch workflows. Key features:

- **Data Ingestion:** Supports CSV, API, cloud storage, and real-time event streams.
- **Pipeline Orchestration:** Processes up to 100K+ records per job—handles throttling, failures, retries.
- **Connectors:** Enterprise-grade connectors extract and normalize data from LinkedIn, Crunchbase, websites, news, and public datasets.

## Architecture and Flow

```text
[Raw Data (API/CSV)]
        ↓
  [Normalization & Validation]
        ↓
   [Parallel Enrichment Controller]
       ↙        ↓        ↘
 [LinkedIn] [Crunchbase] [Website/API]
      ↘         ↓         ↙
   [Aggregation & Deduplication]
        ↓
  [Embeddings/Vector Cache]
        ↓
 [Output: CRM, Dashboard, API]
```

### Key Design Logic

- **Pipeline:** Stateless Lambda or container workers orchestrated via robust central queue (e.g., SQS, PubSub, Kafka).
- **Parallelism:** Async and batch mode to guarantee scale; dynamic rate limiting by source.
- **Success Proof:** 95–99% extraction rates validated vs. ground truth on protected sources (LinkedIn, fintech news, etc.).
- **Caching:** vector embedding cache for repeated queries dramatically lowers cost on common entities.

### Implementation Best Practices

- Clean/standardize inputs—validated domains, deduped names/UIDs.
- Use waterfalling and fallback: attempt feeds, then dynamic extraction only if truly required.
- Monitor source success rates and triggers for pipeline tuning.

## Reference Code

```python
from brightdata import EnrichmentAgent
job = EnrichmentAgent(api_key="YOUR_KEY")
result = job.run(input="leads.csv", mode="async", outputs=["enriched.csv", "CRM"])
```
