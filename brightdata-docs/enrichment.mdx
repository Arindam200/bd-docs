# Data Enrichment Agent

## What is it?
- Instantly enriches company or contact records from any data source (CSV/API)
- Works at real enterprise scale (1K–100K+ records at once)
- Handles LinkedIn, Crunchbase, websites reliably
- Built for teams that want it simple, fast, and compliant

## How it works
1. Upload data or trigger with API
2. Orchestrator splits and manages jobs (so you never hit 429s or bans)
3. Finds company sources (linkedIn, Crunchbase, main site)
4. Unlocks and extracts—all blocking, proxies, and retries handled for you
5. Validates/merges and sends results to your CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)

## Quick Diagram
```text
 [Your Data]
     |
 [Orchestrator]   (all concurrency handled)
     |
[Discovery: find sources]
     |
[Extraction: unlock & scrape]
     |
[Validation ➔ Output (CRM/CSV)]
```

## Best Practices
- Use async mode for batches >1K
- Normalize and deduplicate input for best results
- Prefer Data Feeds where available for highest accuracy

## Why this, not DIY/other?
- Handles LinkedIn and protected sites at 95–99% success (vs 40–60% for basic scripts)
- No proxy/code headaches—just upload & go
- Compliance and legal handled out-of-the-box
- Supports real batch scale (>100K, 99.99% uptime)
