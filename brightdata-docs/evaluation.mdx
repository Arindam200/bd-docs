description: "Fact-check and validate LLM/AI outputs with automated, multi-source evidence—at massive scale."
---

## What is it?

- Instantly fact-checks and validates LLM/model outputs for correctness and reliability
- Automates evidence collection from current and historical authoritative sources
- Scales to 100K+ fact-checks per day with full auditability

## How it works

1. Receives text claims/statements (from LLM/app)
2. Orchestrator splits each claim into atomic facts
3. Finds primary sources: news, SEC filings, reports (SERP, Archive, APIs)
4. Unlocks & validates each fact across multiple sources (current & history)
5. Assigns confidence and generates references + verdicts

## Why it matters

- Proves your answers are grounded in reality, not AI hallucination
- Compliant and audit-ready for enterprise: every fact traced to authoritative source
- Automatic: no manual review or scripting needed—fully API-driven

## Best practices

- Always validate critical facts with >2 sources (current + archive)
- Set thresholds: Flag for manual review if confidence less than 90%
- Use audit trail for compliance and transparency

## Why this over manual/DIY?

- Validates 100K+ outputs at once, no bottlenecks
- Both real-time and historical proof: not just surface “checks”
- 99.99% uptime, legal evidence record, always up-to-date
