# AI Answer Engine Architecture

The **Answer Engine Layer** delivers precise, cited answers or summaries for user or application queries—integrated tightly with the enrichment/research modules.

## Flow & Layers

```text
  [User Query/API/Event]
            ↓
   [Intake/Session Manager]
            ↓
    [Source Discovery+Ranking]
            ↓
    [Data Extraction/Parsing]
            ↓
    [Answer Generation/Synthesis]
            ↓
      [Guardrails+Validation]
            ↓
      [API/UI Response]
```

### Core Architecture Notes

- **Reasoning:** Uses robust LLM/semantic engine, hybrid chaining, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **Validation/Guardrails:** Results auto-fact-checked using independent retrieval. Confidence scoring per result. Outputs always cited (link/source).
- **Serving:** Supports high-concurrency (50K+ qps), session/context awareness. Delivery via streaming API, webhook, or embeddable widget.

### Key Proofs

- > 97% average answer accuracy rate, measured on EU/US benchmarks.
- Millisecond API latencies for cached/instant scenarios.
- Meet strict enterprise audit and reporting standards (SOC 2 Type 2).

## Implementation Guidance

- Integrate with existing CRM/helpdesk for seamless escalation.
- Use feedback loop to auto-correct on non-factual responses.
- Log all outputs for compliance audit.

## Reference Code

```python
from brightdata import AnswerEngine

ae = AnswerEngine(api_key="YOUR_KEY")
answer = ae.ask("What is the current GDPR fine for non-compliance?")
print(answer.text)
```
