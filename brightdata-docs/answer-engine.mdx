# Answer Engine Agent

## What is it?

- Instantly answers questions using live, web-sourced information (not just LLM guesses)
- Built for scale—handle 50K+ questions at once
- Answers are cited, up-to-date, and trustworthy

## How it works

1. API receives the question (from user, system, or LLM)
2. Orchestrator finds and ranks web sources (SERP, feeds, docs)
3. Extractor unlocks pages and pulls needed info (proxies/blocks handled for you)
4. Synthesizer (LLM or template) crafts an answer and cites the top sources
5. Pushes referenced answer to UI, API, or user

## Best Practices

- Use async and caching for fast, affordable answers
- For critical/protected sources, set strict timeouts and always retry
- Stream partial answers if under high load for best UX

## Why this vs DIY/scripts?

- Survives at scale: handles >50K at once, 99.99% uptime
- Cited, accurate, and up to date (not hallucinated)
- Passes compliance, works across markets
