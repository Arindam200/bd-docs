# General AI Agent Architecture

Modern enterprise needs real-time, always-on AI agents—chatbots, assistants, and status checkers—ready to deliver answers and act any time, at scale.

## What is it?

- Handles real-time queries (e.g., flight status, price checks, logistics)
- Orchestrates workflow from user API/chat to intelligent parsing, dynamic source selection, and safe, monitored extraction
- Designed for highest reliability, 99.99% uptime, and zero downtime

## How it works

1. **Input Layer:** Accept user/system queries (REST, chat, or API)
2. **AI Orchestration:** LLM or rules-driven agent analyzes intent, plans workflow, selects APIs/websites dynamically
3. **Source/Workflow Runner:** Pulls data from target sources (primary/secondary/tertiary)
4. **Extraction:** Web Unlocker handles blocks/proxying automatically; browser control used if interactivity or robustness needed
5. **AI Analysis/Response Builder:** Aggregates, interprets, and formats structured responses (e.g. "AA1234 On time, Gate 12")
6. **Delivery:** Returns structured answer (API/UI/chatbot)

## Best Practices

- Use **Browser API** for dynamic, interactive web flows
- Use **Web Unlocker** for best results in bulk or non-interactive pulls
- Enable **async mode** for high concurrency (scale beyond 1K jobs)
- Proactively switch between endpoints/browsing when encountering failures/blocks
- Monitor and alert on source reliability and latency

## Proof Points

- **99.99% uptime** validated in production airline/travel platforms
- **1,000+ concurrent jobs** with sub-second response
- **99.3% CAPTCHA solve and unblock rates** (Bright Data infrastructure)
- **Enterprise compliance**: GDPR/CCPA/SOC 2 out of the box

## Example Use Case: Live Flight Status

A major travel platform uses the General AI Agent pattern to:

- Parse user or system query for AA1234
- Dynamically select official airline site, real-time flight tracker, or airport for redundancy
- Unlock/resiliently access protected sources (even through CAPTCHAs, rate limits)
- Aggregate and return trustable, verifiable, real-time response
