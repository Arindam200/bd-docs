# Reference Architecture for Production-Grade AI Agents

Welcome—this is the fastest way to deploy AI agents that work reliably at enterprise scale, based on real systems running at 100K+ concurrency. Minimal setup. No jargon.

## What is This?

- Blueprint for production-grade, enterprise-ready AI agents
- Built and refined for teams that want reliability, scale, and answers—no devops drama

## Why Care?

- Proven success at global companies (99.99% uptime, 95-99% real-world success, 100K+ jobs)
- Handles LinkedIn, Amazon, Google, news, and more without breaking
- GDPR/CCPA compliant and secure (so you stay out of trouble)

## Quick Navigation

- [Enrichment](enrichment): Fill in gaps in your CRM or contact/company datasets
- [Research](research): Rapid, multi-source market and competitor insights
- [Answer Engine](answer-engine): Automated, referenced answers for users or agents

## Patterns at a Glance

- **Enrichment agents**: Complete company/contact profiles. Scales to >100,000 records. CRM ready.
- **Research agents**: Multi-source real-time research, market/competitor tracking, single touchpoint.
- **Answer engines**: Receives any question, retrieves, synthesizes, and cites sources at high concurrency.

## How It Works (15s Explanation)

1. **Pick your use case**
2. **Use the right agent pattern** (see below)
3. **Run with starter code and diagrams provided**—scale to thousands out-of-the-box

## Architecture Strengths

- Scales to 100K+ concurrent tasks easily
- Handles hardest targets (LinkedIn, ecomm, news, etc.)
- Auto-unblocks, retries, and verifies—all invisible to you
- Always compliant and up-to-date—zero legal risk

---

## Code: Production-Ready Out-of-the-Box

```python
from brightdata import Agent
agent = Agent(api_key="YOUR_KEY")
result = agent.run(pattern="enrichment", data=your_batch)
print(result[0])
```
